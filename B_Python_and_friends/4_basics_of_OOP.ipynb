Notice how the arguments for a class are passed in the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method and hence same number of arguments are to be passed while creating an instance, unless there is a default value assigned to the attribute. A default value can be assigned to an attribute by inserting the attribute_name=value while passing the argument in \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method.

    "<br> Explained simply, the @property decorator allows a method to be called like an attribute without the (). This is useful when you have a case of multiple inheritance or where there are inter-dependencies between attributes. Lets say you have attributes which inherit from a parent attribute. Now when you change the parent attribute outside the class and you want the ones inheriting from the parent to be also inheriting the change automatically, the @property decorator comes in handy. \n",
    "<br> The @property decorator on _method\\_name_ is often followed by @method\\_name.setter decorator. While @property decorator allows you to access a method as an attribute, this setter decorator helps you to achieve exactly what I explained above i.e. making sure that the inheriting attributes also change when source attribute is changed.\n",
    "<br> Lets demonstrate this concept with the following block of code. We will create a class _VideoGame_ which takes attributes: user_name, user_age. We want to create the character name of the user as name_age. However, now if an existing user wants to change his character name, we want that the database also updates the base attributes user_name and user_age accordingly.\n"
