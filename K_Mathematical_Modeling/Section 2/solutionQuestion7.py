print("The simple linear negative feedback module with KAB=KBA treated in Exercise 10 corresponds to the general 2-variables linear system with the coefficients A=0, B=-k, C=k and D=0. Hence, the trace of the ABCD matrix is A+D=0 and the determinant is +k^2. The system is then, in the general map on the figure above, along the vertical axis (p=0), and above the horizontal axis (q>0, Delta<0). We can see on the figure that this corresponds to a phase portrait characterized by a limit cycle. ")
print("Hence, the system will oscillate forever. This corresponds well to the analytical solution we found, where A and B are sine and cosine functions of time respectively.")
print("If the rates KAB and KBA are different, we are still in the same region of the general diagram, hence we will have the same phase portrait (limit cycle, oscillatory behavior). This means that the apparent damping/amplification of the oscillations that we observed when we plotted a numerical solution for a restricted amount of time was only a transcient behavior, part of a more global oscillation pattern.

print("This proves, in our opinion, the power of mathematical analysis over numerical simulations: the latter are necessarily limited in range, since we need to provide computation boundaries to a computer. Analytical resolution of the problems provides a more global vision, to the extent of loosing quantitative accuracy due to approximations required during the resolution. ")
