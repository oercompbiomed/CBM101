print("First let's look at the influence of the total concentrations of A and B. Assume all on/off rates = 1, then if A_0 >> 2* B_0, the phase portrait shows a unique steady state that is stable (as surrounding arrows converge to it). This steady state corresponds to a concentration of trimolecular complex that approaches 0.7-1, so the binding is efficient. If A_0<B_0, then there is again one stable steady state and it correspond to a very low concentration of A, and also of A_2B. So the binding is inefficient. This is also the case if A_0 is just slightly larger than B_0, because the trimolecular complex is not stoichiometric with respect to A and B.")
